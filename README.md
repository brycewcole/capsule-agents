# Capy Agents
*Open Source, simple agents for an A2A world.*

Capy Agents is a framework designed with the goal of making it as easy as possible to create A2A compatible agents. A Capy Agent can be created in a few seconds using either the built in GUI or a configuration file. The resulting agent is a single docker image that can be run anywhere, including on your local machine, in the cloud, or even a Raspberry Pi.

## Features
- **Prebuilt tools**: Includes a set of prebuilt MCP servers that can be enabled in one click.
- **A2A Native**: Designed to work seamlessly with the A2A protocol, making it easy to add external agents.
- **Secure**: The configuration panel can be password protected for added security.
- **Containerized**: Each agent stores state in a local SQLite database.
